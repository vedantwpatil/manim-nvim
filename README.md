# Manim-Nvim 

This is a plugin I am trying to create for neovim which make it easier to work with manim in neovim. This plugin would run a terminal command which tracks a specific file and scene and upon every save command it would recompile the scene. This plugin is mainly inspired by vimtex and I hope to have some of the same functionality as it.

### Dependencies 
Needs entr, manim, neovim

### Notice 
This plugin is likely to take a long time to create as I currently do not have that much experience in creating neovim plugins as well as don't much experience in using lua.
